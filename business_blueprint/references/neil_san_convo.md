# SUMMARY

Santhan Naidoo and Neil Goldberg discuss design consciousness, exploring pre-intellectual quality, designerly thinking, and tacit knowledge as a form of embodied, relational wisdom.

# IDEAS:

*   Design consciousness is about exploring the qualitative felt experience you want a product to catalyze.
*   Post-intellectual meaning tracks to wisdom, an embodied knowledge that allows for novel application over time.
*   A three-part framework for design is pre-intellectual, intellectual, and then post-intellectual or evolutionary.
*   Designerly thinking is an epistemology as powerful as scientific methods for its own kind of problems.
*   It is surprising how little subsequent work has been done to build on designerly thinking.
*   Michael Polanyi’s “tacit knowledge” concept argues we can know more than we are able to tell.
*   Much of our knowledge resides in the body, perception, and integrated sensory and cognitive modes.
*   Chris Alexander wrote of a central quality in things which is objective and precise, but unnamable.
*   This core quality is not an attribute but an emergent coherence between form and context.
*   It is not known in advance but is sensed through practice and discovered in the process.
*   A design's success is affirmed because it is proven to work in actual lived experience.
*   Donald Schon challenged conventional professional knowledge, arguing for an epistemology of practice through reflection.
*   Bruno Latour suggests designing is the antidote to hubris and the search for absolute certainty.
*   Modern people live in constructed worlds but have a bifurcated idea of creation versus reality.
*   Robert Pirsig’s concept of Quality emerges from the relationship between a person and their experience.
*   This unnamable quality can act as a compass, orienting ourselves during a creative journey.
*   The process of creation can involve effortless action guided by this precise but unnamable feeling.
*   We must find ways to communicate that which cannot be named, perhaps through metaphor or poetry.
*   A "design statement" could be created to exist alongside typical mission and strategy statements.
*   Creations, once engaged with by others, begin to develop a field of their own.
*   The Samoan concept of Vā describes the relational space between things, where power exists.
*   South Pacific Islanders viewed the ocean as embodying Vā, the connective space between the islands.
*   Design consciousness is fundamentally about the relational, the fertile space that exists in-between everything.
*   A single compelling quote can be powerful enough to propel an entire person’s career forward.
*   Another person’s inquiry can be the tug that starts a whole thread of thought unraveling.

# INSIGHTS

*   True design is an epistemology of practice, a distinct and powerful way of knowing.
*   The most profound quality in a creation is an emergent property discovered through embodied practice.
*   Wisdom is post-intellectual: an embodied awareness that allows for novel application of deep knowledge.
*   Our most critical knowledge is often tacit, residing in the body beyond explicit, codifiable language.
*   Designing serves as an antidote to hubris, embracing discovery over a search for absolute certainty.
*   The space *between* entities—the relational field—holds the most power, wisdom, and creative fertility.
*   A guiding quality, precise yet unnamable, can orient the creator toward a harmonious final outcome.
*   We must find ways to communicate the unnamable, perhaps through metaphor, poetry, or evocative story.
*   Our lived experience is the ultimate verifier of a design's inherent quality and its success.
*   Creation is not a linear process but a relational dance between creator, object, and user.
*   We live in constructed worlds, yet our philosophies often fail to grasp this artificiality's essential reality.
*   Deep engagement over time transforms intellectual understanding into embodied, applicable wisdom and intuitive knowledge.
*   The most potent creative force is found not in objects but in the relationships between them.
*   Professional skill is best understood not as static knowledge but as a process of reflective practice.

# FACTS:

*   Robert Pirsig wrote about a pre-intellectual experience of "Quality" before we name or distinguish things.
*   Bruce Archer and Nigel Cross coined the term "designerly thinking" for design's unique epistemology.
*   The term "designerly thinking" was introduced in a 1979 article in the journal *Design Studies*.
*   Michael Polanyi, a philosopher of science, is well-known for popularizing the term "tacit knowledge."
*   Polanyi argued that not all knowledge is explicit; much of it resides in the body.
*   Architect Chris Alexander is famous for his influential work on the concept of "pattern language."
*   Alexander described a central, unnamable quality that is objective, precise, and discovered through direct practice.
*   Donald Schon's book *The Reflective Practitioner* had a significant impact on modern design education.
*   Schon called for a new inquiry into the specific epistemology of professional practice itself.
*   Philosopher Bruno Latour wrote an essay on design philosophy called "A Cautious Prometheus?".
*   Latour argued that designing is an antidote to the hubris of seeking absolute, foundational certainty.
*   Robert Pirsig's *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* discusses quality as a relationship.
*   The Samoan concept of Vā, or Mauri Wa, describes the relational space in-between things.
*   South Pacific Islanders considered the ocean connecting islands to be a physical embodiment of Vā.
*   The Vā concept is used to describe the emergent, fertile space between any two entities.
*   Santhan Naidoo is building a tiny home named Estrellita that is located on a farm.
*   Neil Goldberg's career was profoundly propelled by a single quote from L. Bruce Archer.
*   Relatively little subsequent academic work has been done to explicitly build on "designerly thinking."
*   Chris Alexander’s "quality" is an emergent coherence between form and context, not an attribute.
*   Latour noted the modern paradox of living in artificial worlds while denying their essential reality.
