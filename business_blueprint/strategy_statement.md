# Strategy Statement
Our service is for leaders of distributed organizations who believe that offsite retreats & group online events are not enough to build a truly connected culture.

We focus on leaders who want to move beyond awkward icebreakers and create genuine human-to-human trust across their teams.

We promise that our 7-week facilitated program will help their people build the relationships that turn a group of strangers into a true team, long before they ever meet in person.
