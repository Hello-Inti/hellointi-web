# Program Name: The 7 Week Conversation Connectathon

A fully-managed, 7-week internal program designed to build cross-functional trust and generative connections within your distributed team. We handle all logistics, communication, and facilitation.

## Sketch of Program Components:

### Kick-off & Goal Setting (30 min)
A pre-program call with you to align on specific goals, customize internal messaging, and define what success looks like for her & us

### Onboarding
A clear, simple sign-up process and a brief introductory message/video  explaining the "why" and "how" of the program, delivered through slack, discord, messenger or email

### Kick-off meeting for participants
A facilitated pre-program gathering for everyone signed up for the program where we create a high energy container for the 7 week relay. The intent here is playful, creative and inspirational. We cultivate awareness around how powerfully transformational  meaningful conversations can be to the individual, to relationships and the organisation as a whole. We bring to surface shared meaning and purpose.

### Weekly Pairings
Each week, our system randomly pairs every participant with a new colleague from a different team, level, or function to gently dissolve existing silos

### Structured 1-on-1 Conversations (60 min)
Participants are given selected, powerful, research-backed conversation prompts each week, designed to move from surface-level chat to meaningful connection.

### Ongoing Facilitation & Engagement
We maintain a light, encouraging presence in your communication channels to maintain momentum and celebrate participation.

### Weekly (Leadership) Updates
A brief, one-paragraph email to you each week with anonymized participation metrics and highlights.

### Closing circle celebration
We facilitate celebration for everyone who participated

### Final Report
At the end of the 7 weeks, a concise report summarizing participation, key qualitative themes, and recommendations for maintaining momentum.
