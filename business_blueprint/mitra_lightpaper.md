# **Communities**

The web has facilitated the growth of communities of all kinds.

There are so many tools that make it easy to gather people together — like groups, forums, membership sites, courses, event modules.

And there are many tools that enable people within networks to learn about one another and connect directly with one another — like profiles, messaging, video chat.

But, despite these tools, communities are often not reaching their potential to support meaningful connection between members.

Here are four hypotheses on why that might be:



* Organizers tend to focus on creating content and producing events, which are very high cost activities, leaving little bandwidth to facilitate interaction between members
* Connecting members to one another does not map directly to ROI or any kind of short term value creation
* Member-to-member connections are usually invisible, and data can’t be accessed in a way that guides strategic decisionmaking
* There are very few toolsets available to **facilitate** connecting members to one another, accessing relevant insights, and creating value from this activity.

The negative results of this are twofold:



* Community members feel lonely, even though they are part of a community. Even the best content and the nicest events don’t help them feel connected.
* Community organizers feel burned out and exhausted. Despite putting enormous resources into great content and events, their members drift away or tune out.


# **It’s particularly hard for social impact communities**

Many do-gooder organizations suffer a lot from weak communities. Here is what I have seen happen:



* They try to build communities of activists/supporters, but these become pseudocommunity, with content as a substitute for real connection
* Many network members are passive by default, which creates lurkers, stagnant groups and transactional interactions
* Network vibrancy suffers because of facilitator overreliance, which is unsustainable, leads to burnout
* Their capacity to realize their positive social mission doesn't reach its potential and members actually feel worse - discouraged and hopeless


# **The core of the problem**

We all need connection. Our deepest needs — to love, to belong, to thrive, to create, to learn, to contribute, to be seen — can only be met together with others. So we join communities.

But, we soon discover, joining a community doesn’t solve the problem. We still are faced with many decisions and challenges before we can connect.

When we are trying to decide who to spend time with, sometimes we get stuck:



* We pick some people based on limited criteria
* We avoid other people based on a limited view
* We wait for others to take action
* Or, we get overwhelmed by choice and give up

These patterns can narrow our circles and our minds, and isolate us. They cause us to harden into who we have been, at the cost of who we are becoming.


# **The opportunity**

Humans love to play. Games use chance operations within structured settings, because randomness unlocks playfulness, and wipes away seriousness.

When we opt in to let ourselves be surprised, we feel part of the mystery, we go with the flow. We allow synchronicities, we open up to what the Universe wants to gift us with.

However, using chance operations to facilitate good quality socializing within a community requires rigor, too. Our experience shows that certain elements make it more likely to work:



1. **Curated** - Random within a curated group
2. **Available** - Random among those who are explicitly available
3. **Fresh** - Random excludes those you’ve met before
4. **Timeframed** - Set up as a program with a clear start and end
5. **Push** - New random connections are announced on a regular rhythm, such as weekly
6. **Directive** - Instructions are provided and roles are assigned
7. **Accountable** - Participants are nudged to log their actions
8. **Visible** - Stats, graphs, and appreciations are visible
9. **Harvest** - The community benefits in concrete, measurable ways from the activity

The hypothesis is that this works best for communities that have the following features:



* **Common ground:** Members have clear, concrete common ground, such as a course they have taken, a place they have spent time, content they have all read
* **Leader:** There is a passionate, respected community leader.
* **Long term orientation:** The focus of the community relates to work that unfolds over the long term
* **Social impact:** There is an explicit desire among members to have a positive social impact, and there are lots of innovators and early adopters in the community
* **Respectful:** Community members respect one another and strive to keep their word, seeing value in their access to the community and their relationships with members

## **Bright Future Buddies Pilot**

We are partnering with Context Institute to offer Bright Future Buddies, a community engagement program.

In the past 7-week cycle (the second of four taking place in 2019), 28 members of the ~200 member community spent 3,684 minutes of 1:1 video-based meeting time to one another. Participants included members from across the US and Canada, as well as The Netherlands, Germany, Sénégal, South Africa, and New Zealand.

A total of 63 meetings took place, representing 61.4 hours of time that most participants committed without knowing who they would meet or what they would discuss.[^1] See [network graph](https://agitated-meitner-cb7468.netlify.com/) - advance through weeks by hitting the space bar.

Nine network members volunteered to each donate $.01 per minute of logged meeting time to a project the community wanted to support, creating a donation of $331.56.

# **The market**

Here are some players that are facilitating and tracking person-to-person connections within networks. Some are calling this emerging space “network weaving.”[^2]


## **Company culture software**

Several applications randomly match coworkers for conversations to strengthen company culture.[ Donut](https://www.donut.com/), delivered via Slack channels, builds on its free random matching option to include paid features ($5/active user) for onboarding, mentorship, and beyond.

Similar free products include[ Random Coffee](https://www.random-coffee.com/) which began at[ Hootsuite](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanholmes/2017/12/11/how-2000-random-coffees-changed-my-companys-culture/),[ Innovate Brew](http://innovateblue.umich.edu/research/innovate-brew/) at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and [S’Up](https://github.com/ilyakava/sup). [Spark Collaboration](https://bracketcreative.co.uk/igniting-seredipity-a-chat-with-michael-soto-co-founder-of-spark/) had a similar tool which seems to have been discontinued.

A Discourse plugin called [Mingle](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-mingle/95634) does the same thing on that platform.

These products leverage randomness, but they do not confirm availability, provide clear direction about how participants should proceed, or make connections visible within the network, which can lead to disengagement.

A more structured approach to pairing individuals within an academic department for research purposes was explored by researchers at MIT, Georgia Tech and Northwestern.[^3]

# **What this means to me**

Establishing hello Inti comes directly out of my experience as an educator and community developer. I spent 10 years establishing a school teaching people to dance Argentine Tango in Los Angeles. I learned so much — and struggled so much. hello Inti is the tool that part of me kept reaching for without knowing it could exist. It encapsulates the philosophy of openness and adventure that I yearned to infuse into my community. I extend it as a poetic invitation to exhausted, burned out community organizers who keep trying to do old things with old tools, but know that something better is out there.
