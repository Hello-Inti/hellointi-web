# Hello Inti Brand Platform

## Brand Foundation

These are the *bedrock truths* that define our brand’s soul and purpose.

### Brand vision

*What future are you building toward?*

A world where each person is a hub of many collaborative partnerships that together unlock human potential. Humanity as a single global human body with strong, healthy connective tissue gaining momentum in service of the earth.

### Brand mission

*What you’re here to do—our function.*

To help mission-driven networks experience themselves as a healthy, coherent social body.

We help ecosystem stewards undo the tragic and tired old patterns of attempting to create social change through group convening and help them aliven their network through structured peer activation.

We provide the social technology — tools, rituals, and learning — that enable generative 1:1 connections in decentralized, values-aligned, mission-driven communities.

### Brand purpose

*Why do we exist beyond making money?*

To heal isolation, spark inspiration, foster love, and strengthen movements by unlocking people’s capacity to be with, listen to, and learn from each other, one conversation at a time.


### Brand promise

*The core benefit people can count on every time they interact with Hello Inti.*

We promise to hold in our hearts the vision of humanity as a single human body, not 8 billion, and inform every conversation and encounter with the peace, presence and liberating qualities that come from this.

5. Accountability/responsibility/respect. Show up fully, when you say you will.

## Brand origin story

*Our founding myth—a tool for narrative marketing and culture-setting. *

Hello Inti was born out of a vision of humanity as a single, global human body, and the insight that healing and regenerating its connective tissue, one relationship at a time, is the call of our times.

Revealing the social body through enlivening the relational space, instead of using blunt inherited heavy bureaucratic corporate paradigms of group-centric work, helps mission-driven networks develop cohesion, create newness, spark chains of effortless collaboration.

This is a realization that we have carried from a sacred vision, to brave ecosystem leaders stewarding decentralized networks and systems change.

## Brand expression and style elements:

This includes our visual and verbal identity—how the brand looks, feels, and sounds

### Tone of voice:

* Clear and invitational
* Full of self-esteem and respect. A trustworthy container.
* Power in enthusiasm and exuberance - high energy
* Sensuous and borderline poetic (evocative images here and there) but non-indulgent

### Visual language:

* Possible motifs: interlocking organic shapes, flow lines, mirrored forms, two hands, interlocking circles, orbiting shapes.
* Elements or echoes that suggest or imply folk partnered dance traditions (NOT ballroom, NOT competition dance, nothing stylized, and nothing heavy handed or overly literal here).
* Not slick or sterile. Use imperfection and warmth to create emotional resonance.
* Ritual-evoking: Use repetition, icons, or framing to make each part feel meaningful.
* Typography: Elegant serif like Playfair Display paired with a humanist Sans Serif like Lora. Conversational but refined.
