   </td>
   <td>Your students deserve support. It sucks to watch them struggle alone after investing so much in them.
<ul>

<li>Students drift away after the course ends.</li>

<li>They won't integrate the skills they learned in your course.</li>

<li>If they don’t practice, it leads to a lack of gratitude.</li>

<li>Then your grads aren’t there to mentor newbies or advocate for you.</li>

<li>Your hard work feels wasted. </li>

<li>You want to nurture connections but you’re already stretched thin.</li>

<li>Running an online community is a whole different business than teaching!</li>

   <td>“We didn't have an easy, decentralized way to support low-threshold involvement for graduates. HelloInti really worked! People loved it and participation was high. I was surprised by how popular it was. I got to see the energy and the coherence of the network increased, which I count as both a tangible and an emotional benefit." - Robert Gilman, Context Institute, global changemaker network
