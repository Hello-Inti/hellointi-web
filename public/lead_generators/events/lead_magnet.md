   <td>Producing an event is hard, and despite all your work and good intentions, participants can end up having a blah time. They just don’t know how to connect. And it can seem that despite all your hard work finding the perfect facilitators and venue, the connections between people stayed superficial. They came alone, and they left unchanged.

   <td>From a lifetime producing group events, we know intimately the quandary an event designer is in. On the one hand, you need to deliver the goods: the content, the lodging, the meals, ending up within budget, with some Insta-ready happy group photos. On the other hand, people are weird, unpredictable and awkward — needing that personal connection which is so hard to deliver at scale. This dilemma fueled us for a decade to create a solution.

People are bound to fall through the cracks.

<ol>

<li><strong>Change your mental model</strong>. You might be falling into the trap of focusing narrowly on just what happens on-site, once everyone is there and the program begins. But an event really begins the moment the invitation goes out. It’s less like a monolithic high-stakes moment, and more like a gentle upswell that peaks and then transforms into ripples of change, conversation, collaboration. </li>

<li><strong>Rethink your metrics. </strong>Reflect on what success means to you and your team and what you’re trying to optimize for. Events bring out human vanity that can get in the way of network-weaving. If your only metrics have to do with attendance, satisfaction, NPS scores and Insta-worthy photos, the experience will subtly stress everyone out. To complement this, here are four powerful kinds of relational metrics to focus on: </li>
<ol>

<li>Pre- and Post- Network Mapping, measuring the number and quality of new ties formed</li>

<li>Relational Capital and Social Trust metrics. Did participants feel seen and understood? Connected? </li>

<li>Psychological Safety and Belonging metrics. These related participants’ willingness to contribute and help predict whether collaboration continues after the event.</li>

<li>Role Clarity & Activation Metrics. We can measure publicly shared commitments, post-event working groups, cross-team collaborations, volunteers, or even just next steps identified. </li>
</ol></li>

   <td>
<ol>

<li><strong>Get the right toolset. </strong>Online community platforms, social media groups, ticketing platforms and collaboration software are not designed to help you create an unforgettable event. They put too much focus on one-to-many connecting, not enough on the intimate, 1:1 peer-pairings that help people build confidence and warmth before an event, and activation and resolve afterwards.
    Then you have random-coffee or AI-powered peer matching tools seem like the answer, but they end up working more like superficial networking or speed-dating mixers instead of faciliating authentic relational capital.
<p>

    Pairathons, delivered through a software custom-built to foster warmth and connection, are different. They exercise participants’ capacity to attune to one another with podcast-quality 1:1 conversations that bring our each other’s genius. With them you expand the footprint of your event through pre- and post- peer activation sprints without having to lift a finger. </li>

   <td>If your event isn’t sparking collaboration, creating network density, and building your movement’s momentum, all the energy you put in will dissipate. Don’t let your event be just another overstuffed  gathering of big names, too-much content, and shiny pictures of big groups. Events that intentionally build relational capital are the ones that create strong, enduring organizations and legacies. You can do this.
