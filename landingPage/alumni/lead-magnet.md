| Agitate the problem. Speak to the emotional frustration a person may experience when dealing with the challenge you help solve | Building community is a job, a hard job.

Create a high-retention flywheel for your course grads without the headache of online platforms  
Don’t let your grads drift away

It sucks to teach an amazing, heartfelt, transformative course and then have everything you’ve built just fizzle away. 

You bust your butt on marketing. Even though it’s not your thing, you do it to find the people who need you. And then facilitating the course takes a ton of energy. 

You know that your students need practice and motivation but you know what? You can’t babysit a Facebook group on top of all your other jobs. So grads just scatter and you’re lucky if they open your emails again. 

We poured a decade of research into solving this problem for our grad network. Eventually friends and colleagues who run courses wanted to use it too\! We think it’s the simplest, easiest, least-burdensome way to keep your keep alumni connected to each other and your work — WITHOUT more content, facilitation or “community”-building, because you have enough to do\! 

**The answer is the art of alumni-to-alumni conversations**

Building community is a job, a hard job. It’s exhausting to burden yourself with the heavy work of facilitating an online community  — and end up giving away free content, time, and consultations to the loudest members, while your quiet talent and hidden leaders slowly drift away. 

**WHAT IF?**

Imagine a scalable way to keep people connected across cohorts, that keeps them coming back for something that’s NOT your content, that doesn’t depend on your precious life-force. An elegant way for them to stay involved that keeps them learning, growing, and training in the skills and awarenesses you already worked so hard to teach them. 

Here’s the aha: Stop trying to gather them into groups, online or off. Instead, pair them up for conversations related to their shared interest, that give them value. 1:1 conversations are easier to schedule, more likely to be successful, and less work for you. 

**The five most valuable ways to pair up members of your course grad network:** 

* Practice partner. If they need to practice a new interpersonal skill like interviewing, pitching, nonviolent communication, or even a martial art or social dance, they’ll value the chance to practice live.
