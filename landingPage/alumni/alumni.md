**BrandScript template for Instructors**

**How we set up the service for instructors, super lean:** 

* No live kickoff call, just a launch email inviting people to the program and explaining how it works. We will include a short video we make together with the instructor.   
* We set up a link where their community members can join the program  
* For each new pairathon, we craft a new email with a short video  
* Behind the scenes handle all the matching and community support  
* After each pairathon we create a short email recap that the instructor can adapt and share with the community including the appreciations link

**Packaging and pricing:** 

* We sell packages of 3 7-week pairathons/year. They can choose which three: New years, Spring, Summer, Fall and adjust dates to meet programs  
* What if we price it based on community size? E.g. \- three tiers  
  * Active users who join the pairathon?   
  * Number of total course graduates?   
  * Other measures?

|  | The Stakes | Your students deserve support. It sucks to watch them struggle alone after investing so much in them.   Students drift away after the course ends. They won't integrate the skills they learned in your course. If they don’t practice, it leads to a lack of gratitude. Then your grads aren’t there to mentor newbies or advocate for you. Your hard work feels wasted.  You want to nurture connections but you’re already stretched thin. Running an online community is a whole different business than teaching\! |

|  | Empathy  | We understand how it feels to care deeply about your work, pour your heart into teaching, work your ass off in marketing, and then feel deflated when your grads drift away.  |

I got to see the energy and the coherence of the network increased, which I count as both a tangible and an emotional benefit." \- Robert Gilman, Context Institute, global changemaker network |
